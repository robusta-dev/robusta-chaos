# Why another chaos engineering tool
Because we love Python.

We want chaos engineering to be simpler.

We want to make the chaos scenarios easily understandable by everyone who knows a little Python.

We want to make it easier to add your own chaos scenarios specific to your company.

Robusta lets us do all of that with one simple Python function per chaos scenario.
